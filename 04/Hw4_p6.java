/*
 * create a HashMap instance myMap
 * create an ArrayList instance myArrayList create a LinkedList instanc
 * myLinkedList
 * 
 * Repeat the following 10 times and calculate average total insertion time and
 * average total search time for each data structure
 * 
 * generate 100,000 distinct random integers in the range [1, 1,000,000] and
 * store them in the array of integers insertKeys[ ]
 * 
 * // begin with empty myHap, myArrayList, and myLinkedList each time
 * 
 * // Insert keys one at a time but measure only the total time (not individual
 * insert // time)
 * // Use put method for HashMap, e.g., myMap.put(insertKeys[i], i)
 * // Use add method for ArrayList and LinkedList
 * 
 * insert all keys in insertKeys [ ] into myMap and measure the total insert
 * time
 * insert all keys in insertKeys [ ] into myArrayList and measure the total
 * insert time
 * insert all keys in insertKeys [ ] into myLinkedList and measure the total
 * insert time
 * 
 * generate 100,000 distinct random integers in the range [1, 2,000,000] and
 * store them in the array searchKeys[ ].
 * 
 * // Search keys one at a time but measure only total time (not individual
 * search // time)
 * // Use containsKey method for HashMap
 * // Use contains method for ArrayList and Linked List
 * 
 * search myMap for all keys in searchKeys[ ] and measure the total search time
 * search myArrayList for all keys in searchKeys[ ] and measure the total search
 * time search myLinkedList for all keys in searchKeys[ ] and measure the total
 * search time
